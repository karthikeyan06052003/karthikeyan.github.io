    <h1>ARDUINO BASED RADAR SYSTEM</h1>
    <p>In my first year I had the opportunity to do a project called as radar system using arduino. I did this project to present in a intercollege competition. It was a great opprtunity to showcase my skills in electronic projects. While the competition did not culminate in victory, I embraced the experience as an invaluable learning opportunity.Ultimately, the project served as a stepping stone in my academic journey, igniting a profound interest in electronics and empowering me to take on more innovative ventures in the future.</p>
    <p>COMPONENTS USED</p>
    <li>Arduino</li>
    <li>ultrasonice sensor</li>
    <li>servo motor</li>  
        <p>Softwares used</p>
        <li>ARDUINO IDE</li>
        <li> ProcessinG IDE </li>
        <p>With the help of Arduino I controlled the ultrasonic sensor used to measure the distance of a target or object by transmitting ultrasonic waves and converts the reflected waves into an electrical signal.With the reference to the waves I attached a servo motro to rotate it in 180degree to confirm the presence of object.
        FInally with the help of Processing IDE I displayed the radar in a visual art manner. That was was more accurate to detect the presence of object.

        <h1>IOT BASED INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION SYSTEM</h1>
        <p>
        My second poroject was IOT based industrial protection system. I had the opportunity to present this project in the ECUBE(project presentation) which was conducted in our college.</p>
        <p>COMPONENTS USED
            <li>ESP32, Temperature sensor</li>
            <li> PIR motion sensor</li>
            <li>GAS sensor,Buzzer</li>
            <li>Relay</li>
            <p>SOFTWARE USED</p>
            <li>ARDUINO IDE</li>
            <li>BLYNK</li>
        <p> The IoT-based Industrial Safety Monitoring System is a cutting-edge solution that employs sensors and a network of connected devices to monitor and control various industrial processes. This system ensures the safety of workers and the environment by detecting potential hazards and taking preventive measures. The core of the system is an ESP32 DEVKIT module, chosen for its robust WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity capabilities. This project demonstrates the effective use of 3 sensors - DHT11 temperature sensor, MQ135 gas sensor, and PIR motion sensor - to measure critical parameters. Additionally, it utilizes 3 buzzers and a relay module for timely notifications. The system triggers the buzzers and alerts the users when threshold limits are exceeded for temperature or gas levels. It also detects any unauthorized personnel by activating the buzzer when movement is detected near the PIR sensor. Moreover, real-time data can be monitored remotely using a Blynk application on both PC and mobile devices, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless monitoring. 
        This project serves as a stepping stone, inspiring further exploration and development in the exciting field of electronics and IoT-based applications.

        <h1>AIR PURIFIER</h1>
        <p>We have successfully developed a cutting-edge, compact air purifier specially designed to efficiently and affordably cleanse indoor spaces from impurities and pollutants. This revolutionary device was born as part of our college's SBI (Societal Beneficiary Innovation) initiative, driven by the vision of our esteemed secretary, to create a product that can be accessible to those in need.This innovation is not just a product; it represents a profound commitment to serving our community. By making this air purifier accessible to the needy, we aim to enhance the quality of life for countless people, empowering them to breathe easier and lead healthier lives. Our dedication to social welfare drives us, and we believe this air purifier is a significant step towards a cleaner and greener future for all.

        <h1>EARLY DETECTION OF PROSTATE CANCER</h1>
        <p>It is a sensor-based bio-medical detection device that detects tumours and cancer in the prostate gland by
            means of high-intensity focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound transmission and reception.
            </p>
            <p>It is an innovative devices which utilizes concepts of sensors, bioelectronics and medical electronics as per requirement to achieve desired outcome. It is practically a detection tool that is equipped with peizoelectric protrusion that plays a major role in emitting ultrasonic rays in target region. By receiving the ray the place of obstruction is noted in the display. Cancerous and tumorous protruision can be observed and marked by positioning the rays that are not received back due to these obstruction.</p>
            <p>As of now it is in the develpoment phase,THEIA is one of the example of our agenda to teach our next generation. Technology is considered a good one only if it is made accessible and feasible by all and harms none. This is one of our pedestal to enlighten the need of UN SDGs to our generation in order for a better generation. THEIA will be a remarkable innovation in field of diagnostic and medical electronics and will do her duty with utmost efficiency.
