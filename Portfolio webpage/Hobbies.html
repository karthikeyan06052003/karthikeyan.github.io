            <p>Kho Kho, a traditional Indian sport, weaves a tapestry of agility, strategy, and teamwork, embodying the spirit of our cultural heritage.The kho kho tournament held in our college served as a platform to foster camaraderie and sportsmanship among various departments, promoting a healthy competitive spirit while celebrating our shared passion for sports. As a defender on the team, I embraced a unique role that demanded a distinct set of skills and strategic acumen. My contributions as a defender were driven by a profound sense of pride in safeguarding our team's position and fortifying our defense during intense matches.</p>

        <h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>Photography is the art and practice of capturing images using a camera to preserve moments, memories, and emotions.Engaging in the art of capturing cloud formations during the magical moments of dawn, sunset, or sunrise has become an enriching and gratifying hobby for me. Immersed in this pursuit, I find myself captivated by the mesmerizing beauty of the ever-changing skies.
        The interplay of colors, light, and textures during these transient periods offers a unique canvas for my photography. Each click serves as a testament to the fleeting beauty of nature, reminding me of the impermanence and splendor of the world around us.</p>
